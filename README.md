# aire-learner-scorecard
Personalized learner analytics dashboard for the AIRE Program, providing individual-level insights, rubric-based prompt feedback trends, and AI-generated learning recommendations. Public release with synthetic data and reproducible Streamlit code.

## Personalized Learner Analytics (Public Version)
This public build centers learner-facing insights by surfacing rubric trends, engagement patterns, and AI coaching tips designed to improve prompt quality and grounding. It mirrors the AIRE Impact Dashboard priorities—clarity, accuracy, depth, and ethical use—so learners see how their work aligns to program outcomes. All shared artifacts use synthetic telemetry to keep data private while preserving realistic patterns for reproducibility. Deployments can optionally point to real telemetry by configuring `.env` with your credentials and API keys, enabling the same views on production data when permitted.
